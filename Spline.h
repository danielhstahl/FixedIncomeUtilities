/*Given arrays x[0..n] and y[0..n] containing a tabulated function, i.e., yi = f(xi), with
x1 < x2 <...< xN , and given values yp1 and ypn for the first derivative of the interpolating
function at points 0 and n, respectively, this routine returns an array y2[0..n] that contains
the second derivatives of the interpolating function at the tabulated points xi. If yp1 and/or
ypn are equal to 1 Ã— 1030 or larger, the routine is signaled to set the corresponding boundary
condition for a natural spline, with zero second derivative on that boundary.*/
